# How to get started contributing to Distribute Aid
We’re not currently set up for async-only contributions so if you’re interested in joining, we encourage you to get in touch with our tech team lead at <tech@distributeaid.org> to get properly onboarded.

A lot of our team communication happens in virtual meetings: we have a monthly sprint meeting and two tech hangs a week. None of these are mandatory but they allow us to pair up on issues, unblock each other, and find the right people to pick up issues. Any other collaboration usually happens via Slack.

If you join our team, you’ll get invites to our tech hangs and our Slack, as well as our contributor team on GitHub.

# What we’re looking for
Our volunteers typically contribute about 5 hours a week. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Downtimes are of course expected and we’d rather people take breaks and stick around than burn out and drop off. We appreciate folks who are willing to stay long-term as less turnover ensures we can make better progress on our projects.

# What we offer
Having a team structure in place allows us to foster both collaboration and individual growth. Those who have been around for a bit and gotten familiar with a part of our stack usually start doing peer reviews. We also encourage contributors who are willing to take on some responsibility to step up and get on track to become maintainers.

We offer periodic one-on-ones with our tech lead to our regular contributors to ensure they’re feeling adequately challenged in their work at Distribute Aid and to make sure they get the chance to grow as they wish. Of course we’re also happy to write a reference for regular contributors as needed.

If this sounds interesting to you, [get in touch](mailto:tech@distributeaid.org) and tell us a bit about yourself.

### Looking for frontend devs!
We’re currently looking for a frontend dev (or two) to help create a dedicated landing page for our [HRT Toolkit project](https://www.omprakash.org/global/distribute-aid/crowdfund/hrt---harm-reduction-toolkit). You’d be teaming up with one of our designers, our technical program manager, and the project lead of the HRT Toolkit project for a tighter collaboration to focus on creating the landing page (estimated duration for this project is approximately three months).
