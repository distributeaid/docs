information regarding specific types relating to the needs assessment scripts

some types have had a property name change compared to the name referenced in the historic data:

- **need** from the historic data becomes **amount** in the `Need` type
- **survey id** from the historic data becomes **reference** in the `Survey` and `Need` types

Some changes were made to align with the desired content-field requirements of the Strapi collection, while others were made to enhance clarity of the content-field.

May need to explain types relating to the UploadWorkflowStatus for tracking preprocessing results of the data.
