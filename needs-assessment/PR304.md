# Populating the NeedsAssessment.Need collection:
To populate the [needs collection](./needs-collection.md) we need to gather the [id number](./id-number.md) for specific fields from other [collections](./collections.md) in Strapi:
- The [survey collection](./survey-collection.md) holds a list of [surveys](./surveys.md) and we need to grab the [id](./ids.md) of the current survey being referenced with the specific need.
- The [region collection](./region-collection.md) holds a list of [regions](./regions.md) and we need to grab the [id](./ids.md) of the current region being referenced with the specific need.
- The [subregion collection](./subregion-collection) holds a list of [subregions](./subregions.md) and we need to grab the [id](./ids.md) of the current subregion being referenced with the specific need, if there is one. Not every need has a subregion.
- The [item collection](./item-collection.md) will hold a list of [items](./items.md) and we need to grab the [id](./ids.md) of the current item referenced with the specific need.

We also require the total amount of items requested for the specific need. For clarity, the need property in the historic data was changed to "amount" in the [Need type](./types.md) for the script in order to align with the [field types](./field-types.md) in the Strapi need collection. It comes straight from the json data and does not have an id from another collection.
