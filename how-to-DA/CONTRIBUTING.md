# How to get started contributing to Distribute Aid

We’re not currently set up for async-only contributions so if you’re interested in joining, we encourage you to get in touch with our tech team lead at <tech@distributeaid.org> to get properly onboarded.

## Expectations

Most of our contributors put in an average of 5h a week. Volunteer participation fluctuates as people’s lives do, so we ask contributors to communicate proactively.

A lot of our team communication happens in virtual meetings: 1 sprint meeting/month and 2 tech hangs/week where we hang out and collaborate. We’ve seen that people who show up to these consistently are having a better experience, make more progress, growing in skills, personal abilities, and confidence!

Tech hangs: every Wednesday and Thursday from 6 to 8 pm CET/CEST
Sprint meetings: first hour of the tech hang on the first Wednesday of the month

Any other collaboration usually happens via Slack.

**Join our contributor team if:**

- you’re able and willing to communicate clearly
- you’re reliable, organised and focused
- you have some availability overlapping with Central European Time
- you can make it to at least 1 tech hang per month
- you can come to at least 1 sprint meeting per quarter

## What we’re looking for

We’re looking for experienced engineers and designers, but you don’t need to already know our full stack as long as you know how to onboard yourself and ask for help if needed. Some experience with contributing to OSS is helpful.

Stack: NextJS, TypeScript, Strapi, Radix UI

### Backend

As a Backend Developers at Distribute Aid, you’ll develop and maintain our backend for our website, work with APIs to share and structure collected needs data for our needs assessment as well as data visualisations to show our work. You’ll most likely collaborate with other Backend devs.

Stack: Strapi (our website’s backend), TypeScript, APIs

### Design

### Data

Part data engineer, part data analyst, you’ll work with historical data from our Needs Assessment as well as future incoming Needs Assessment data.

### Other areas

Got any other skills you think could help us? Project management, writing, documentation, video, etc. Get in touch and let us know!

# What we offer

Having a team structure in place allows us to foster both collaboration and individual growth. We emphasise doing peer reviews and encourage contributors who are willing to take on more responsibility to step up and get on track to become maintainers.

Regular contributors get access to periodic 1on1s with our tech lead to check in and enable personal development and growth at Distribute Aid. We’re also happy to write references for regular contributors as needed.

If this sounds interesting to you, [get in touch](mailto:tech@distributeaid.org) and tell us a bit about yourself.
